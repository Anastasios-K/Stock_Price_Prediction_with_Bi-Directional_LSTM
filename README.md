## Overview
An ML pipeline for time-series (stock price) classification which is developed taking into consideration \
the main principles of Object-Oriented and Data-Oriented Programming. The current Data-Oriented Strategy \
Pattern, allows users to change the behavior of the pipeline, choosing between different TensorFlow\Keras \
algorithms. This design also assures the execution of mandatory steps whereas, it provides flexibility between \
a number of optional functions. For more detail, look at the [Pipeline](#The-Pipeline) section.

## How to use

- Modify data path in the [config-file](https://github.com/Anastasios-K/Stock_Price_Prediction_with_Bi-Directional_LSTM/blob/main/src/config/config.yaml), 
  if any of the case below  
  If the data is not located in the default data folder.
  Or if a different dataset
